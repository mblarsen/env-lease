			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Scaffolding and Initialization",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the existing subtasks, expand this task by creating the specified directory structure. Then, create a `cmd/root.go` file to define the main `cobra.Command` for `env-lease`. Create two entrypoint files, `cmd/env-lease/main.go` and `cmd/env-leased/main.go`, that both call the root command's `Execute()` function. Finally, remove the placeholder `main.go` from the project root and ensure `go mod tidy` and `go build ./...` run successfully.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms this is a greenfield project. The task involves standard Go project setup and `cobra` boilerplate. There are no existing abstractions to leverage or complex logic to write. The complexity is low as it follows well-established patterns."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configuration Parsing (`env-lease.toml`)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating a new package `internal/config`. Inside, create `config.go` to define the `Config` and `Lease` structs. Implement the `Load(path string)` function using the `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` library. After parsing, add logic to iterate through the leases to validate required fields (like `Source`) and apply default values (like `Type` defaulting to 'env'). Finally, create `config_test.go` with unit tests covering valid files, missing required fields, and default value application.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows the `internal/config` directory is non-existent, making this a greenfield task. The complexity comes from defining the data structures, integrating a third-party library (`toml`), and implementing custom validation and default value logic, which requires careful error handling and thorough unit testing."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Define SecretProvider Interface",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a new file `internal/provider/provider.go`. Within this file, define the `SecretProvider` interface with a single method: `Fetch(source string) (string, error)`. Add comments explaining the purpose of the interface and its method.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms the `internal/provider` package needs to be created. This task is purely about defining a Go interface, which is a very simple, non-complex operation. It requires no logic, just a type definition in a new file."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement IPC Framework with HMAC Security",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating the `internal/ipc` package. Create a `protocol.go` file to define the message structs (`GrantRequest`, etc.) and a `security.go` file for the HMAC `Sign` and `Verify` functions. Create `server.go` to implement a `Server` that listens on a Unix Domain Socket, verifies, and decodes messages. Create `client.go` to implement a `Client` that encodes, signs, and sends messages. Finally, create `ipc_test.go` with an integration test that spins up a server and verifies client communication.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms this is a greenfield implementation. This task is highly complex as it combines three distinct domains: low-level networking with Unix sockets, cryptographic operations for message signing (HMAC), and protocol design for serialization/deserialization. It requires careful implementation of both client and server components and robust integration testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Atomic File Writer Utility",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a new package `internal/atomic`. In `atomic.go`, implement the function `WriteFile(filename string, data []byte, perm fs.FileMode) error` that writes to a temp file and then renames it. In `atomic_test.go`, write unit tests that verify correct file content and permissions on success, and test failure modes like the destination directory not existing.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows no existing utility for this. While the logic is straightforward (temp file -> write -> rename), it requires careful handling of file system operations, permissions, and error conditions across multiple steps. The need for robust unit tests for file I/O adds to the complexity, making it more than a trivial task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Daemon State Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating a `state.go` file in the `internal/daemon` package. Define the necessary structs to represent the daemon's state (e.g., a map of active leases). Implement `LoadState(path)` and `SaveState(path)` functions using `encoding/json` for serialization. `LoadState` should handle a non-existent file by returning a new, empty state. `SaveState` should ensure the target directory exists. Create `state_test.go` to test these functions, including edge cases like corrupted JSON.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms the `internal/daemon` package is the correct place but lacks this implementation. The task involves data structure design, file I/O, serialization with `encoding/json`, and robust error handling for edge cases like file corruption or missing paths. This combination makes it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Daemon Core Logic and Timer Loop",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating `daemon.go` in the `internal/daemon` package. Define the main `Daemon` struct, holding dependencies like the state manager. Implement the `Run()` method which first performs a startup check to revoke any leases that expired while offline. Then, start a `time.Ticker` loop. Inside the loop, on each tick, iterate through active leases, check for expirations, and trigger the revocation logic for any that have expired. Ensure state is saved after any changes.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows this is the core greenfield logic for the daemon. Its complexity is high because it's the heart of the daemon, managing the application's main lifecycle, state transitions, and time-based events. It requires careful management of the state and interaction with other components (revocation, state persistence) within a continuous loop."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Daemon Revocation Failure Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by modifying the daemon's state struct in `internal/daemon/state.go` to include a retry queue for failed revocations, tracking attempt counts and next retry times. In `daemon.go`, modify the main loop to process this queue, using an exponential backoff algorithm to reschedule failed attempts. If a lease's initial failure time exceeds 5 minutes, implement logic to create a `.envrc.env-lease-REVOCATION-FAILURE` file in the project directory.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis indicates this is a significant modification to the core daemon logic (Task 8). The complexity is high because it introduces a new state management concern (the retry queue), requires implementing a time-based algorithm (exponential backoff), and adds failure-mode logic that interacts with the filesystem. This is a complex feature layered on top of the core loop."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating a new file `cmd/daemon_darwin.go` with a `//go:build darwin` build tag. Inside, create a `daemon` subcommand for the root command. Add `install` and `uninstall` subcommands to it. The `install` command should generate a `launchd.plist` from an embedded template, write it to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, and run `launchctl load`. The `uninstall` command should run `launchctl unload` and remove the file.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows no existing OS integration. This task is moderately complex because it involves OS-specific logic, requiring the use of build tags. It necessitates generating configuration files from templates, performing file I/O in system-specific directories, and interacting with external system commands (`launchctl`) via `os/exec`, which requires careful error handling."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by creating a new file `cmd/daemon_linux.go` with a `//go:build linux` build tag. Inside, create a `daemon` subcommand and add `install` and `uninstall` subcommands. The `install` command should generate a `env-leased.service` file from an embedded template, write it to `~/.config/systemd/user/`, and run `systemctl --user enable --now`. The `uninstall` command should run `systemctl --user disable --now` and remove the file.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms this is a new, OS-specific feature. Similar to the macOS task, its complexity comes from requiring build tags, generating service files from templates, writing to specific user directories, and executing external system commands (`systemctl`) via `os/exec`. The logic is platform-specific and requires robust error handling for external process interaction."
