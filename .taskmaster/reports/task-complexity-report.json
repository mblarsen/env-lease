			"taskTitle": "Bugfix: Make `grant` Command Idempotent by Ignoring Same-Value Overrides",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for implementing the idempotency check. Create separate subtasks for handling `env`-type leases (line-by-line check) and `file`-type leases (full content check). Also, create a dedicated subtask for adding the integration tests described in the test strategy to verify both the successful idempotent runs and the conflict cases.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate (4/10) because it involves modifying core file I/O logic for two different lease types (`env` and `file`) and integrating it with existing override checks. However, the logic itself (byte-for-byte comparison) is simple and avoids complex parsing. Breaking it into 3 subtasks (one for each lease type's implementation and one for testing) provides a clear and manageable workflow."

			"taskTitle": "Bugfix: Preserve Unrelated Content in `.env` Files During Grant",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for refactoring the `.env` grant logic. Create a subtask to design and implement a self-contained utility that can parse `.env` file content, update or append a specific key-value pair, and return the modified content while preserving comments and blank lines. Create a second subtask to integrate this utility into the daemon's `handleGrant` function. A third subtask should ensure this new logic correctly incorporates the idempotency check from Task 29. Finally, add a subtask to implement the full integration test suite as described.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex (7/10) as it requires a fundamental change from a simple file write to a full read-parse-modify-write cycle. It involves creating a robust `.env` file parser that handles comments and formatting, managing content in memory, and performing an atomic write. The dependency on Task 29 adds another layer. The 4 subtasks isolate the complex parsing logic into a reusable utility, separate integration work, explicitly address the dependency, and ensure thorough testing for this critical change."

			"taskId": 31,
			"title": "Implement `file_mode` Option for File-Type Leases",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks. The first subtask should focus on updating the TOML configuration parsing by adding the optional `file_mode` field to the lease struct. The second subtask should implement the core logic within the daemon to read this new field, parse the string value into an `os.FileMode` with validation, apply a default of `0644` if absent, and pass it to the file writing function. The final subtask should be to create the unit and integration tests to verify that files are created with the correct permissions in all cases.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity feature (3/10). It involves small, well-defined changes in three separate areas: configuration parsing, daemon logic, and file I/O. No major architectural changes are needed. The logic for parsing the mode string and applying a default is straightforward. Three subtasks are recommended to map directly to the distinct stages of work: updating the data model (config), implementing the business logic (daemon), and verifying the result (testing)."
